# Pong Game

Pong is a classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. This Python implementation uses the Turtle module to create the game environment and handle user input.

## Gameplay

Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle. The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and score points by causing the ball to miss the opponent's paddle. The game continues until one player reaches the score limit or decides to end the game.

### Controls

- Control the right paddle with the Up and Down arrow keys.
- Control the left paddle with the W and S keys.

### Rules

- The ball bounces off the walls and paddles.
- If a player misses the ball with their paddle, the opposing player scores a point.
- The first player to reach the score limit wins the game.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: The game simulates realistic paddle and ball movement, providing an immersive gameplay experience.
- **Scoreboard**: Keep track of the score with the scoreboard displayed on the screen.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the game settings such as paddle speed, ball speed, and score limit to tailor the game to your preferences.
- **Simple and Intuitive Controls**: The controls are easy to learn, making it accessible for players of all skill levels.
